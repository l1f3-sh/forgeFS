# forgeFS - File-Sharing Server and client 

## Overview
**forgeFS** is a file-sharing system built in C consisting of a server and client backend. This project is a personal journey to learn and master systems programming concepts, including network programming, file I/O, concurrency, and security practices.
The System will allow clients to connect to a server, upload or download files, list available files, and disconnect gracefully. 

## Learning Goals
- Network programming: Implementing TCP sockets for client-server communication
- File I/O: Handling file transfers efficiently and securely
- Concurrency: Managing multiple clients using threading and other techniques
